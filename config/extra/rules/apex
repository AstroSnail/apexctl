// If you want to give options to setxkbmap like you would normally do,
// you have some work to do. You can copy the options you want from
// /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev under "! option = symbols"
// like you see above.
// After that, you need to modify the apex.lst file, and add a corresponding
// entry there. You'll find instructions in that file.
//
// If you don't want to duplicate work however, I recommend adding the
// options directly to model '*'. For example:
// ! model = symbols
//   *     = pc+%l%(v)+inet(evdev)+compose(menu)
